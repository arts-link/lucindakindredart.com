Cindy Kindred resides in Salt Lake City.  Her work is derivative of the Australian Aboriginal Art which she loves.  Cindy’s career was in media and communications and she was the founder and owner of Vanguard Media Group, a full-service advertising agency in Salt lake City from 1994- 2011.  Her hobbies include travel, reading and sewing, which she translated into her art during the Pandemic.  Cindy uses embroidery stitching to create fabric art pieces that are inspired by Aboriginal Art patterns and stories.  “I was surprised that most aboriginal art is acrylic paint on bark or canvas.  It seems so naturally to translate to fabric and colorful thread.”

Cindy’s travels to Australia introduced her to Aboriginal Art. Through Euan Hill and the Art Mob Gallery in Hobart Tasmania, from whom she has purchased several Aboriginal works of art, she was introduced to the Lockhart River Arts group. Cindy recognized that her Aboriginal inspired fabric art pieces simply wouldn’t exist without the inspiration and creativity of the Australia’s Aboriginal Artists. Inspired by their work and that of other Aboriginal Artists, Cindy decided to dedicate her time and her creativity to supporting this community and its Aboriginal Artists.
