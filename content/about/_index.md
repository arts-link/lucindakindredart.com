Cindy Kindred resides in Salt Lake City.  Her work is derivative of the Australian Aboriginal Art which she loves.  Cindy’s career was in media and communications and she was the founder and owner of Vanguard Media Group, a full-service advertising agency in Salt lake City from 1994- 2011.  Her hobbies include travel, reading and sewing, which she translated into her art during the Pandemic.  Cindy uses embroidery stitching to create fabric art pieces that are inspired by Aboriginal Art patterns and stories.  “I was surprised that most aboriginal art is acrylic paint on bark or canvas.  It seems so naturally to translate to fabric and colorful thread.”
