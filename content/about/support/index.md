Cindy’s travels to Australia introduced her to Aboriginal Art. Through Euan Hill and the Art Mob
Gallery kn Hobart Tasmania, from whom she has purchased several Aboriginal works of art, she
was introduced to the Lockhart River Arts group. Cindy recognized that her Aboriginal inspired
fabric art pieces simply wouldn’t exist without the inspiration and creativity of the Australia’s
Aboriginal Artists. Inspired by their work and that of other Aboriginal Artists, Cindy decided to
dedicate her time and her creativity to supporting this community and its Aboriginal Artists.

Cindy donates all proceeds from her artwork to the Lockhart River Arts group. Through her website and exhibitions, she raises both funds and awareness for Aboriginal Art and the Community, contributing to their mission of preserving and sharing their culture.

For Cindy, creating art is a way to give back and connect with a cause she cares about. Her work reflects her appreciation for Aboriginal Art through the Lockhart River Community and her desire to support their artistic and cultural efforts.
