Cindy Kindred discovered a new purpose for her art after her daughter, Nicole, moved to Australia. Through this connection, she learned about the Lockhart River Arts group and the rich cultural traditions of Australian Aboriginal peoples. Deeply inspired, Cindy decided to dedicate her time and creativity to supporting this community.

Cindy donates all proceeds from her artwork to the Lockhart River Arts group. Through her website and exhibitions, she raises both funds and awareness for the group, contributing to their mission of preserving and sharing their culture.

For Cindy, creating art is a way to give back and connect with a cause she cares about. Her work reflects her appreciation for the Lockhart River community and her desire to support their artistic and cultural efforts.
