Cindy donates all proceeds from her artwork to the Lockhart River Arts group. Through her website and exhibitions, she raises both funds and awareness for Aboriginal Art and the Community, contributing to their mission of preserving and sharing their culture.

For Cindy, creating art is a way to give back and connect with a cause she cares about. Her work reflects her appreciation for Aboriginal Art through the Lockhart River Community and her desire to support their artistic and cultural efforts.
