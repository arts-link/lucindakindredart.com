### ARTIST'S STATEMENT

Cindy Kindred resides in Salt Lake City. Her work is derivative of the Australian First Nation Aboriginal Art which she loves. Her hobbies include travel, reading and sewing, which she translated into her art during the Pandemic. Cindy uses embroidery stitching to create fabric art pieces that are inspired by Aboriginal Artist’s patterns and stories. “I was surprised that most Aboriginal First Nation art is acrylic paint on bark or canvas. It seems so naturally to translate to fabric and colorful thread.” This is her second exhibit. All profits from sales are donated to the Lockhart River Arts Indigenous Corporation, a First Nation Art Collective.
