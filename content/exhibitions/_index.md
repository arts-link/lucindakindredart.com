Cindy Kindred’s exhibitions feature her intricate fabric art, inspired by Australian Aboriginal patterns and stories, with each event showcased here as a gallery. 

She is currently exhibiting at Evolutionary Healthcare through end of January 2025. She has exhibited at the Salt Lake Community College (SLCC) and the Sprague Library branch in Salt Lake City.  All proceeds from these exhibitions are donated to the [Lockhart River Arts group](https://lockhartriverart.com.au/) in Australia, supporting their mission to preserve and celebrate Aboriginal cultural traditions.
