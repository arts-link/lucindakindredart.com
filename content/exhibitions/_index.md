Cindy Kindredâ€™s exhibitions feature her intricate fabric art, inspired by Australian Aboriginal patterns and stories, with each event showcased here as a gallery. Current exhibitions include displays at Salt Lake Community College, the Sprague Branch Library, and the EHC Clinic patient waiting area. All proceeds from these exhibitions are donated to the [Lockhart River Arts group](https://lockhartriverart.com.au/) in Australia, supporting their mission to preserve and celebrate Aboriginal cultural traditions.
